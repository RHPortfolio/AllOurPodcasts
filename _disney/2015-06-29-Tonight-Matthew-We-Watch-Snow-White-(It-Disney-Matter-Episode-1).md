This is the first episode from Me3 Comedy's brand new Disney themed podcast, in which we, comedy lovers Marianne MacRae and Richard Hanrahan, endeavour to watch and discuss every Disney film, in order.

In order to do what, I hear you ask? Well that's a very good question - and one we will come to answer over the course of this P'cast.

In today's ep', we discuss Snow White, and generally try and work out what it is we are hoping to do with this thing, on the fly.

"On which fly?" you moan like a rudder imprisoned by its rut, wielded by a fool lost in the sea of his own eyes; we do not respond.
