Our Christmas special! We dedicate our time to exploring the best not Christmas films to watch at Christmas, the quintessential experience that do not feature a tree or a santa or a mince pie. We also take some time to explore some AI generated alternative podcast titles, just to settle the mood

PLEASE NOTE: This originally appeared under a different podcast feed as 'Seasons'. In July 2023 we re-branded to 'Films with... Benefits'.
