Welcome back to "Films with... Benefits" with your favourite British Father/Wife duo, Marianne MacRae and Richard Hanrahan of Me3Comedy! Each week, Marianne and Richard curate three unique film seasons - from heartwarming classics to hidden gems, squirming through tangents like they're going out of fashion.

This week, we take a nostalgic trip down memory lane with "Films you'd always see on a shelf in a VHS rental Shop." Remember spending ages picking a film you'd all watch that night? After that, we plunge ankle deep into "The Rainforest Is Dying" season,  which my AI assisted copy insists we want to"shed light on the urgent need for environmental awareness and preservation". And finally, we look at the comedic genius of Steve Martin in our attempt to curate the essential "Steve Martin Films".

So, grab your popcorn, settle in, and join us as we curate imaginary film festivals none of us will ever be bothered enough to watch. With humour, charm, and a touch of nostalgia, we'll take you on a cinematic journey you won't want to miss. Lights, camera, banterâ€”let's ask the AI to regenerate this cringe copy!
