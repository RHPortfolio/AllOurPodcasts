Told you we would be back! As promised, many moons ago, the internet's favourite Father/Wife pair Marianne MacRae and Richard Hanrahan (aka Me3Comedy) have returned with a slightly reformatted podcast. No longer 'Seasons', we are now 'Films with... Benefits', much more searchable I'm sure you will agree.

Each week, Marianne and Richard curate three unique film seasons in each episode - from heartwarming classics to hidden gems, all the way to Mrs Doubtfire, again...

In this episode we discuss the charms of our namesake, "Films with Benefits", and explain why we've changed our podcast name. Then, we discuss the cute adventures of "Films with Lil' Pals," and unpick this week's community voted theme: "6ix Word Titles". So grab a bag of popcorn and get ready as we dive into curating imaginary film festivals that no one will ever see! As our AI assisted copy suggests: Lights, camera, banter!
